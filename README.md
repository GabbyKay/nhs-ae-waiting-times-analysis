# NHS A&E Waiting Times Analysis (England, 2023–24)

## Problem
NHS Accident & Emergency (A&E) departments continue to experience pressure in meeting the four-hour waiting time standard. This project analyses provider-level performance across England to identify where performance issues occur, when they worsen, and why.

## Data
- Source: NHS England – A&E Attendances and Emergency Admissions
- Period: April 2023 – March 2024
- Level: Provider-level (NHS Trusts and independent providers)

## Methodology
- Cleaned and standardised monthly provider-level datasets
- Appended 12 months of data into a single master table
- Used PivotTables to analyse:
  - Provider performance variation (WHO)
  - Time-series trends (WHEN)
  - Demand vs performance relationship (WHY)

## Key Insights
- Significant variation exists between providers in compliance with the four-hour standard
- Performance deteriorates during winter months, indicating seasonal pressure
- Higher A&E attendances are associated with reduced performance for many providers

## Recommendations
- Targeted operational support for consistently underperforming providers
- Proactive seasonal capacity planning
- Strengthening alternative urgent care pathways to reduce avoidable demand

## Tools
- Microsoft Excel
- PivotTables
- Time-series and comparative analysis
